This is because, the atoms and molecules in a crystal are extremely well aligned, and they are anisotropic. This can separate incominb beams into two beams with precisely orthogonal linear polarization states. They also work well over large wavelength range. There are many different configurations. Calcite is most often used in crystal-based polarizers, because of large birefringence, low absorption in visible. Many other suitable crystals including quartz. Quartz are way more abundunt.\n",
